## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or newer)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (as a package manager)

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd MyProjectName
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Application Directory**

    The main application is located in the `app` directory. Change to this directory:

    ```bash
    cd app
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the necessary Node.js dependencies with Yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

    Start the local development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    After running the command, you should see a message indicating that the development server is running. You can now open your browser and go to the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (`/app`), you can run:

- `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `yarn serve`: Locally preview the production build.
- `yarn test`: Runs the test runner (if set up).
